# Contact Messages Dashboard - Umbraco 16 Migration

This custom section has been migrated from the old AngularJS-based architecture to the new Umbraco 16 Web Components architecture.

## Migration Changes Made

### 1. Section Registration
- ✅ **CORRECTED**: Removed incorrect C# section class (ISection doesn't exist in Umbraco 14+)
- ✅ **NEW APPROACH**: Section is now defined in the manifest using extension type "section"

### 2. Package Manifest
- ✅ Converted `package.manifest` to `umbraco-package.json` with new schema
- ✅ Added section extension definition using manifest-based approach (no C# required)
- ✅ Updated manifest to reference the new web component

### 3. Frontend Migration
- ✅ Replaced AngularJS controller with TypeScript/Lit web component
- ✅ Converted HTML template to Lit template syntax
- ✅ Updated to use new Umbraco UI components (uui-*)
- ✅ Implemented proper state management and lifecycle

### 4. API Controller
- ✅ Updated to inherit from `UmbracoAuthorizedApiController`
- ✅ Added proper HTTP method attributes and error handling

## Quick Testing (No Build Required)

For immediate testing, I've created a simple JavaScript version that works without any build process:

1. **Restart your Umbraco application** (required for new extensions and API controller)

2. **Test the API directly** by navigating to:
   ```
   /umbraco/backoffice/ContactMessages/Contact/Test
   ```
   This should return a JSON response like: `{"message":"API is working!","timestamp":"..."}`

3. **Check the section** in the Umbraco backoffice navigation

## Full TypeScript Build (Optional)

If you want the full TypeScript/Lit implementation:

1. Navigate to the contactMessages plugin directory:
   ```bash
   cd App_Plugins/contactMessages
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the TypeScript component:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Update the manifest to point to the built file:
   ```json
   "element": "/App_Plugins/contactMessages/dist/contact-messages-dashboard.js"
   ```

## Features Preserved

- ✅ Pagination with configurable page sizes
- ✅ Contact message display with truncated messages
- ✅ Date formatting
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling with notifications
- ✅ Responsive design

## New Features Added

- ✅ Modern TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Improved accessibility
- ✅ Modern UI components
- ✅ Better loading states

## Important Note About Umbraco 14+ Architecture

**CORRECTED APPROACH**: In Umbraco 14+, custom sections are **NOT** created using C# classes implementing `ISection`. Instead, they are defined entirely through the manifest system using extension type "section". This is a fundamental change from earlier versions.

The section is now defined in `umbraco-package.json` as:
```json
{
  "type": "section",
  "alias": "contactMessages",
  "name": "Contact Messages",
  "meta": {
    "label": "Contact Messages",
    "pathname": "contact-messages"
  }
}
```

## Testing

After building, restart your Umbraco application and:

1. Navigate to the backoffice
2. Look for the "Contact Messages" section in the main navigation
3. Click on it to see the dashboard
4. Verify that contact messages load correctly
5. Test pagination and page size changes
